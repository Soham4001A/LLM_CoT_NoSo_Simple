# LLM_CoT_NoSo_Simple

ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest research: "A Not-So-Simple Way to Beat SimpleBench" ðŸ§ 

In this paper, we demonstrated how baseline models such as OpenAI's GPT-4o and Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus can achieve performance comparable to the latest frontier models on SimpleBench (https://simple-bench.com/)â€”without the need for explicit retraining. By implementing active iterative reasoning through structured prompting and feedback loops, we elevated these models to rival, and in some cases surpass, CoT-enabled counterparts. Additionally, we proposed future directions, including integrating specialized models for step generation, enhancing feedback mechanisms to efficiently resolve logical diversions, and exploring hybrid approaches that combine reasoning paths from multiple models to improve robustness and adaptability.

I am excited for AGI, are you?
